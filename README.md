# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This repo is not a complete full project, hence it's a project where it just uses only react hooks, it doesn't contain state optimization such as "reducers" or "redux".

The completion of this project will be in new repository by including mern backend with advanced frontend designs and other features are in process, it's just a frontend application made with ReactJS, Redux, Firebase , etc..
